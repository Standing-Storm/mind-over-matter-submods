# Mind Over Matter: Submods

A collection of submods for Mind Over Matter to tweak some aspects of the mod, generally making it easier. Details listed below:

- MoM_Always_Awaken: Tweaks the formula so that attempting to awaken a new psionic path is always successful. 
- MoM_Harsher_Nether_Attunement_Scaling: Changes Nether Attunement scaling to be less generous than default, starting at 40% of default values, hitting 100% of default values at Nether Attunement 6, and reaching 166% of default scaling at Nether Attunement 12.
- MoM_Harsher_Nether_Attunement_Scaling_No_Negative: The same as MoM_Harsher_Nether_Attunement_Scaling, but also removes negative nether attunmement effects. Use this instead of MoM_No_Negative_Nether_Attunement if you want the harsher scaling.
- MoM_Head_Explode: If you roll the Headache Nether Attunement effect when you already have the Headache Nether Attunement effect, there is a chance your head explodes and you die. 
- MoM_Infinite_Concentration: Removes the limit for the number of powers you can concentrate on at once. Being stunned, breaking a limb, or falling asleep will still end concentration on your powers. 
- MoM_No_Calorie_Cost: Removes the kcal cost from psionics usage. 
- MoM_No_Negative_Nether_Attunement: Removes all the negative effects of Nether Attunement but keeps the power boost from having high levels of Nether Attunement.
- MoM_No_Nether_Attunement, removes all effects of Nether Attunement and most ways to gain it. While contemplation recipes will still cause Nether Attunement, it will have no effect on the game. Only choose this one or MoM_No_Negative_Nether_Attunement, otherwise only the last-loaded submod will have an effect. 
- MoM_Raise_Pain_Disabling_Psi_Limit: Doubles the amount of pain you can suffer before pain disables your powers.
- MoM_Remove_Learn_Power_Delay: Removes the random delay before becoming eligble for learning new powers.
- MoM_Remove_Observed_Nether_Effects: Changes the two Nether Attunement effects that require Observed but are harsher into a headache.
- MoM_Remove_Pain_Disabling_Psi_Limit: Removes the possibility of pain disabling your powers.

If there's desire, I can also add submods to make it more difficult.
