# Mind Over Matter: No Nether Attunement
Removes the negative, or all, effects of Nether Attunement in the CDDA mod Mind Over Matter.

There are two separate submods. The first, MoM_No_Negative_Nether_Attunement, removes all the negative effects of Nether Attunement but keeps the power boost from having high levels of Nether Attunement. The Second, MoM_No_Nether_Attunement, removes all effects of Nether Attunement and most ways to gain it. While contemplation recipes will still cause Nether Attunement, it will have no effect on the game. Only choose one of these submods, otherwise only the last-loaded submod will have an effect.
