# Mind Over Matter: Submods

A collection of submods for Mind Over Matter to tweak some aspects of the mod, generally making it easier. Details listed below:

- MoM_Always_Awaken: Tweaks the formula so that attempting to awaken a new psionic path is always successful. 
- MoM_Infinite_Concentration: Removes the limit for the numbner of powers you can concentrate on at once. Being stunned, breaking a limb, or falling asleep will still end concentration on your powers. 
- MoM_No_Calorie_Cost: Removes the kcal cost from psionics usage. 
- MoM_No_Negative_Nether_Attunement: Removes all the negative effects of Nether Attunement but keeps the power boost from having high levels of Nether Attunement.
- MoM_No_Nether_Attunement, removes all effects of Nether Attunement and most ways to gain it. While contemplation recipes will still cause Nether Attunement, it will have no effect on the game. Only choose one of these submods, otherwise only the last-loaded submod will have an effect. 
- MoM_Remove_Learn_Power_Delay: Removes the random delay before becoming eligble for learning new powers.

If there's desire, I can also add submods to make it more difficult.
