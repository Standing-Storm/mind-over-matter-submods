# Mind Over Matter: Submods

A collection of submods for Mind Over Matter to tweak some aspects of the mod, generally making it easier. Details listed below:

- MoM_Always_Awaken: Tweaks the formula so that attempting to awaken a new psionic path is always successful. 
- MoM_Awakening_Is_Rarer: Tweaks the formula so that attempting to awaken a new psionic path is much more difficult than the default.
- MoM_Calorie_Cost_Does_Not_Cause_Weariness: By default, the calorie expenditure from using psionics is the same as exercise, causing weariness and eventually making you very or extremely weary. This submod removes that, preventing psionics usage from affecting your weariness.
- MoM_Experience_Edits: There are three subfolders--use only one. Each increases the experience gained when channeling or contemplating powers. One by 2x, one by 4x, and one by 10x. 
- MoM_Feral_Psions_Always_Drop_Crystals: Chance of a non-lab-based feral psion dropping some kind of crystal is increased to 100%.
- MoM_Harsher_Nether_Attunement_Scaling: Changes Nether Attunement scaling to be less generous than default, starting at 40% of default values, hitting 100% of default values at Nether Attunement 6, and reaching 166% of default scaling at Nether Attunement 12.
- MoM_Harsher_Nether_Attunement_Scaling_No_Negative: The same as MoM_Harsher_Nether_Attunement_Scaling, but also removes negative nether attunmement effects. Use this instead of MoM_No_Negative_Nether_Attunement if you want the harsher scaling.
- MoM_Head_Explode: If you roll the Headache Nether Attunement effect when you already have the Headache Nether Attunement effect, there is a chance your head explodes and you die. 
- MoM_Increase_Random_Power_Delay: Increases the timer before being eligible to learn new powers from 12 to 168 hours to 7 to 30 days. Use if you really like long games or turn the default skill gain rate down. 
- MoM_Infinite_Concentration: Removes the limit for the number of powers you can concentrate on at once. Being stunned, breaking a limb, or falling asleep will still end concentration on your powers. 
- MoM_No_Calorie_Cost: Removes the kcal cost from psionics usage. 
- MoM_No_Negative_Nether_Attunement: Removes all the negative effects of Nether Attunement but keeps the power boost from having high levels of Nether Attunement.
- MoM_No_Nether_Attunement: removes all effects of Nether Attunement and most ways to gain it. While contemplation recipes will still cause Nether Attunement, it will have no effect on the game. Only choose this one or MoM_No_Negative_Nether_Attunement, otherwise only the last-loaded submod will have an effect.
- MoM_No_Overload: Removes power overloaded from a failed channel or from using your powers at too high Nether Attunement. This is not a Nether Attunement effect.
- MoM_Power_Learning_Is_Automatic: Reduce the difficulty of the metaphysics roll to learn a new power to 1, ensuring success.
- MoM_Power_Learning_Is_Harder: Increase the difficulty of the metaphysics roll to learn a new power by 3, from power Difficulty + 4 to power Difficulty + 7.
- MoM_Power_Learning_Is_Instant: Reduces the time required to meditation to learn a new power from several hours to one second.
- MoM_Raise_Pain_Disabling_Psi_Limit: Doubles the amount of pain you can suffer before pain disables your powers.
- MoM_Remove_Learn_Power_Delay: Removes the random delay before becoming eligble for learning new powers.
- MoM_Remove_Learn_Path_Power_Checks_Delay: Removes the delay before checking whether you actually learn a power once eligible.  Combined with the previous mod, fulfilling the prerequisites will make you nearly-instantly learn new powers.
- MoM_Remove_Observed_Nether_Effects: Changes the two Nether Attunement effects that require Observed, summoning the Hounds and opening a Tear in Reality, into a headache.
- MoM_Remove_Pain_Disabling_Psi_Limit: Removes the possibility of pain disabling your powers.
- MoM_Remove_Teleport_Volume_Limit: Removes all limits on Teleportation powers based on carried volume.
